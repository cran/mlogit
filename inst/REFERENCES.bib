abstract = { This paper develops a theoretical model of location
                  choice under imperfect competition to formalize the
                  notion that firms prefer to locate “where the
                  markets are.” The profitability of a location
                  depends on a term that weights demand in all
                  locations by accessibility. Using a sample of
                  Japanese firms' choices of regions within European
                  countries, we compare the theoretically derived
                  measure of market potential with the standard form
                  used by geographers. Our results show that market
                  potential matters for location choice but cannot
                  account entirely for the tendency of firms in the
                  same industry to agglomerate. }

                  to model consumer choices from among a discrete set

                  the difficulty of constructing welfare estimates in

                  usually asked to select their most preferred option
                  from a set. Preferences can be estimated more
                  efficiently if respondents are asked to rank all

                  perform the ranking task, using the complete ranking
                  may lead to a substantial bias. We introduce a model

                  capabilities of individuals. Estimated preferences
                  based on this model are more efficient when at least
                  some individuals are able to rank more than one
                  item, and they do not suffer from biases due to

                  statistical methods to examine the choices that
                  consumers, households, firms, and other agents
                  make. Each of the major models is covered: logit,
                  generalized extreme value, or GEV (including nested
                  and cross-nested logits), probit, and mixed logit,

                  explored, including the use of the
                  Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and its variant Gibbs

                  service proposals to alleviate intercity travel
                  congestion. This paper develops a new
                  heteroscedastic extreme value model of intercity
                  mode choice that overcomes the ‘independence of
                  irrelevant alternatives’ (IIA) property of the
                  commonly used multinomial logit model. The proposed
                  model allows a more flexible cross-elasticity
                  structure among alternatives than the nested logit
                  model. It is also simple, intuitive and much less of
                  a computational burden than the multinomial probit
                  model. The paper discusses the non-IIA property of
                  the heteroscedastic extreme value model and presents
                  an efficient and accurate Gaussian quadrature
                  technique to estimate the heteroscedastic model
                  using the maximum likelihood method. The multinomial
                  logit, alternative nested logit structures, and the
                  heteroscedastic model are estimated to examine the
                  impact of improved rail service on business travel
                  in the Toronto-Montreal corridor. The nested logit
                  structures are either inconsistent with utility
                  maximization principles or are not significantly
                  better than the multinomial logit model. The
                  heteroscedastic extreme value model, however, is
                  found to be superior to the multinomial logit
                  model. The heteroscedastic model predicts smaller
                  increases in rail shares and smaller decreases in
                  non-rail shares than the multinomial logit in
                  response to rail-service improvements. It also
                  suggests a larger percentage decrease in air share
                  and a smaller percentage decrease in auto share than
                  the multinomial logit. Thus, the multinomial logit
                  model is likely to provide overly optimistic
                  projections of rail ridership and revenue, and of
                  alleviation in inter-city travel congestion in
                  general, and highway traffic congestion in
                  particular. These findings point to the limitations
                  of the multinomial logit and nested logit models in
                  studying intercity mode choice behavior and to the
                  usefulness of the heteroscedastic model proposed in

                  of pairs of alternatives. This restriction is
                  inappropriate for many choice situations; those in
                  which some pairs or sets of alternatives share the
                  same unobserved attributes. The nested logit (NL)
                  model relaxes the zero covariance restriction of the
                  MNL model but imposes the restriction of equal
                  covariance among all alternatives in a common nest
                  and zero covariance otherwise. The paired
                  combinatorial logit (PCL) model relaxes these
                  restrictions further by allowing different
                  covariances for each pair of alternatives. This

                  terms. In random coefficient models, this marginal
                  monetary value is the ratio of two random
                  coefficients and is thus random itself. In this
                  paper, we study the distribution of this ratio and
                  particularly the consequences of different
                  distributional assumptions about the
                  coefficients. It is shown that important
                  characteristics of the distribution of the marginal
                  monetary value may be sensitive to the
                  distributional assumptions about the random
                  coefficients. The median, however, is much less
                  sensitive than the mean. Copyright 2006 John Wiley

abstract = {Abstract In this paper we propose a dynamic multinomial
                  probit model in order to estimate the long-run and
                  short- run effects of marketing mix variables on
                  brand choice. The latent variables, which contain
                  the unobserved perceived utilities, follow a
                  first-order vector error correction autoregressive
                  process of order 1 with current and lagged
                  explanatory variables. The unrestricted
                  autoregressive parameter matrix concerns the
                  intertemporal correlation in perceived utilities of
                  households over purchase occasions and indicates the
                  persistence in brand choice. As explanatory
                  variables we consider relative prices and
                  promotional activities like feature and display. An
                  important and novel feature of our model is that it
                  allows for different long-run and short-run effects
                  of promotional activities, thereby extending the
                  models that are currently available in the
                  literature. Additionally, to account for different
                  base preferences for brands across households, we
                  allow for consumer heterogeneity. Our application
                  concerns a panel of households choosing among
                  several brands of a FMCG. Our estimated model turns
                  out to be an improvement over a static model and
                  over a model with only short-run effects, in terms
                  of in-sample fit and out-of-sample
                  forecasts. Copyright 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {This paper considers mixed, or random coefficients,
                  multinomial logit (MMNL) models for discrete
                  response, and establishes the following
                  results. Under mild regularity conditions, any
                  discrete choice model derived from random utility
                  maximization has choice probabilities that can be
                  approximated as closely as one pleases by a MMNL
                  model. Practical estimation of a parametric mixing
                  family can be carried out by Maximum Simulated
                  Likelihood Estimation or Method of Simulated
                  Moments, and easily computed instruments are
                  provided that make the latter procedure fairly
                  efficient. The adequacy of a mixing specification
                  can be tested simply as an omitted variable test
                  with appropriately defined artificial variables. An
                  application to a problem of demand for alternative
                  vehicles shows that MMNL provides a flexible and
                  computationally practical approach to discrete
                  response analysis.},

                  discrete-continuous mixture distribution, which must
