an article submitted to the Journal of Statistical Software ; it is
less exhaustive, but better writen thant the original mlogit vignette.

## miscellanous

* the id series (one observation per choice situation) was badly
  constructed, it is now fixed

* the levels of the choice variable are now equalized to the those of
  the alt variable, allowing the case were some alternatives are never
  chosen

  covariates. At the end of model.matrix.mformula, the linear
  dependent columns of X are removed

* bug in the effects method fixed


# mlogit  0.2-4

* the list of primes used to generate halton sequences was too
	short, its length has been increased

* halton sequences where used to estimate mixed logit even for
	the default value of halton (NULL), this has been fixed

* the contribution of each observation to the gradient is not
	returned as the 'gradient' element of mlogit objects

	returned in case of unknown distribution

# mlogit 0.2-3
	
* some sys.frame() changed to parent.frame() 

# mlogit 0.2-2

* ranked-order models can be now estimated ; a new argument called
	'ranked' is introduced in mlogit.data which performs the relevant
	transformation of the data.frame. The estimated model is then a
	standard multinomial logit model

* multinomial probit model is now estimated by setting the new
	probit arguments to TRUE

	observation

	starting values are changed according to constPar

* the vcov method for mlogit objects is greatly enhanced.

* mlogit objects now have two elements which indicate the fitted
	probabilities : fitted is the estimated probability for the
	outcome and probabilities contains the fitted probabilities for
	all the alternatives

	moreover, the intercepts are now called altname:('intercept')

	logit model

* the norm argument is added to rpar

* the logLik argument is now of class logLik

* mlogit.data is modified so that an id argument can be used with
	data in long shape

	now called id.var

	models can handle unbalanced data (pb with Reduce)
 
* the three tests are temporary removed
	
# mlogit 0.1-7

* a bug in mFormula (effects vs variable) is fixed

	model.matrix.mFormula

* if the choice variable is not an ordered factor, use as.factor()
	instead of class() <- "factor"

* cov.mlogit, cor.mlogit, rpar , med, rg, stdev, mean functions
	are added to extract and analyse random coefficients.
	
* a panel argument is added to mlogit so that mixed models with
	repeated observation can be estimated using panel methods or not

* a problem with the weights argument is fixed

* the estimation of nested logit models with a unique elasticity
	is now possible using un.nest.el = TRUE

* the estimation of nested logit models can now be done with or
	without normalization depending on the value of the argument
	unscaled

# mlogit 0.1-4

* mlogit didn't work when the dependent variable was an ordered
	factor in a "wide-shaped" data.frame.

* the reflevel argument didn't work any more in version 0.1-3.


# mlogit 0.1-3

* major change, most of the package has been rewriten

* it is now possible to estimate heteroscedastic, nested and mixed
	effects logit model

	optimization function is provided for efficiency reason

# mlogit 0.1-2

* robust inference is provided with meat and estfunc methods
	defined for mlogit models.

* subset argument is added to mlogit so that the model may be
	estimated on a subset of alternatives.
