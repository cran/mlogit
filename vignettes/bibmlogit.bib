                  choice under imperfect competition to formalize the
                  notion that firms prefer to locate “where the
                  markets are.” The profitability of a location
                  depends on a term that weights demand in all
                  locations by accessibility. Using a sample of
                  Japanese firms' choices of regions within European
                  countries, we compare the theoretically derived
                  measure of market potential with the standard form
                  used by geographers. Our results show that market
                  potential matters for location choice but cannot
                  account entirely for the tendency of firms in the
                  same industry to agglomerate. }

                  literature to model consumer choices from among a
                  discrete set of alternatives, and they typically
                  impose a constant marginal utility of income on
                  individual preferences. This assumption is driven
                  partially by the difficulty of constructing welfare
                  estimates in models with nonlinear income
                  effects. Recently, McFadden (1995) developed an
                  algorithm for computing these welfare impacts using
                  a Monte Carlo Markov chain simulator for generalized
                  extreme-value variates. This paper investigates the
                  empirical consequences of nonlinear RUMs in the case
                  of sportfishing modal choice, while refining and
                  contrasting the available methods for welfare
                  estimation. }

                  cross-sectional and panel (longitudinal)
                  data. Unobserved heterogeneity is modeled by
                  allowing the parameters to vary randomly over
                  individuals according to a continuous, discrete, or
                  discrete-continuous mixture distribution, which must
                  be chosen a priori by the researcher. In particular,
                  the models supported by gmnl are the multinomial or
                  conditional logit, the mixed multinomial logit, the

                  problems and more than 100 times for larger
                  problems. Running in parallel mode on a multicore
                  machine gives up to 4 times additional speedup on 8
                  processor cores. mnlogit achieves its computational
                  efficiency by drastically speeding up computation of
                  the log-likelihood function's Hessian matrix through
                  exploiting structure in matrices that arise in
                  intermediate calculations. This efficient
                  exploitation of intermediate data structures allows
                  mnlogit to utilize system memory much more
                  efficiently, such that for most applications mnlogit
                  requires less memory than comparable software by a
                  factor that is proportional to the number of model
                  categories.},

abstract = {Abstract In economic research, it is often important to
                  express the marginal value of a variable in monetary
                  terms. In random coefficient models, this marginal
                  monetary value is the ratio of two random
                  coefficients and is thus random itself. In this
                  paper, we study the distribution of this ratio and
                  particularly the consequences of different
                  distributional assumptions about the
                  coefficients. It is shown that important
                  characteristics of the distribution of the marginal
                  monetary value may be sensitive to the
                  distributional assumptions about the random
                  coefficients. The median, however, is much less
                  sensitive than the mean. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley
